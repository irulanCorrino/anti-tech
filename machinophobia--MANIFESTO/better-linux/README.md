# BETTER LINUX
##### as of june 2022 we have no OS/environment that is able to satisfy needs of a music performer [saying 'environment' i mean some hypothetical system dedicated to music production that is running on bare hardware without any OS involved]. operating systems range from unusable paid stuff posessing extremely limited capabilities to produce sound to renowned free software that is potentially offering unlimited functionality but is impossible to maintain for a musician without programming background. among all the operating systems i tried [Fodos [PDP11 or CP/M]; Windows OS; Syllable/Rex-linux; jNode; Singularity; Free BSD; QNX; linux] only linux was usable and friendly. in this piece i am not going to propose any new features to linux --instead i name things a real-world programmer does not need. indeed we could return to the days when we had no OS involved in between hardware and user application producing music much like Doom was run without DOS back in 1995 and i recollect i was writing stuff in Basic for ZX Spectrum without any OS installed... but that is not progressive way to write programs.
### here are the things a real-world programmer does not need:
- without POSIX linux would be much better;
- without mitigations of vulnerabilities linux would be much better;
- without firewalls linux would be much better;
- without antiviruses linux would be much better [arch wiki (List of software) proposes clamav and i have some experience with software produced by clam
-- as a musician i used clamChordata --it was SUCH A PIECE OF TRASH];
- without apparmor linux would be much better;
- without systemd linux would be much better;
- without udev linux would be much better;
- without X11 or Wayland linux would be much better;
- [consequentially] without widget toolkits (GTK, Qt, EFL or whatever else) linux would be much better. i guess real programmer does not need such stuff; only people that received any kind of formal education may benefit from those frameworks but just like creators of those toolkits they use visual editors designed for rapid application/interface development and in reality no one of them is able to code in a programming language. it is just like using stone scraper for cleaning a hide of hunted animal for paying for that stone scraper... you cannot use your nails for cleaning the hide and you cannot wear a stone for clothes!!!
####### you may ask 'But WHO needs you performing your non-classist music?' --and who may need hides and stone scrapers?
