### this is a place where i put my considerations on what is wrong in mass-production software [particularly i focus on poorly designed interfaces]
##### my reader should understand that listed by me interface misfits do affect me and that in most cases they render a software piece as being completely unusable because i am with quiet rare type of sight that makes me being 3D-blind. [unlike human species currently do my biological species do not use terms like 'illness' or 'impairment' for my sight type]

- reader must know that by no means my points are attempts to ridicule other software developers.
- i am a Handdarra follower so it implies some ways i perceive the Reality. all men are with perception finely shaped to what it is after their language education faith and biological nature of a being.
- some things like habits or religious believes make man's perception rigid and one raised with a false sensation that stars are unanimated objects will never see them as living beings.
- and dear humans PLEASE understand that if most of my stances would be interpreted by you as being offensive that JUST BECAUSE of our biological differencies --i am an ambivalent woman so while you would try to track my opinions down to ambivalent attitude to high social values or whatsoever THAT is nothing but your alien status with usage of TERNARY LOGIC that makes you to be so.
#### a crying example:
- i am not a democrat [ach] so i do not support positions of any socialist-driven country;
- i live in oppressive country which illegally annexed a part of another one and wages the the war on that country;
- so while i may both harshly criticise and to take the point of view of an informational and software giant trying to comply with sadistic laws of an oppressor i do not ridicule them for stepping back!!!
- instead i provide you with the following sections depicting plainly ridiculous things

>```
>'Under President Vladimir V. Putin, who once called the internet a “C.I.A. project” and views the web
>  as a threat to his power, the Russian government is attempting to bring the country’s once open and freewheeling
>  internet to heel.
>...Sometimes caged behind lock and key, the new gear linked back to a command center in Moscow, giving
> the authorities startling new powers to block, filter and slow down websites that they did not want the Russian
>  public to see.'
>'The law, which took effect on Jan. 1, [2022] requires foreign websites and social media platforms that have over
> 500,000 daily users to register as legal entities in the country, with a locally based leader. It also requires
>  the companies to register an account with Roskomnadzor and to create an electronic form for Russian citizens
>  or government authorities to contact the companies with complaints.'
