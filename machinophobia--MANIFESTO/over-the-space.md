- '`Real-time 11` is a discontinued small, low-end, single-user real-time operating system for the full line of Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11 16-bit computers. RT-11 was first implemented in 1970. It was widely used for real-time computing systems, process control, and data acquisition across all PDP-11s. It was also used for low-cost general-use computing'[^1]
- while i was a teenager i studied programming in the school —tnere was RT‑11 OS clone about which my teacher told confusingly '`FODOS` is [derived from] `Unix`, it is used on "big machines" in Computing Centers'[^2]

### 'Vilnius BASIC[^4] is [was[^5]] a dialect of the BASIC programming language running on the Elektronika BK-0010-01/BK-0011M and UKNC computers.'
> ```
> Vilnius Basic
> 
> Paradigm           imperative, algorithmic
> First appeared     1986; 36 years ago
> Dialects           BASIC-86, BASIC-88
> Influenced by      MSX BASIC
> Influenced         None
> ```
- 'It was a quite advanced BASIC and, instead of being an interpreter like most systems of the day, featured a `runtime threaded code compiler`[^6] that compiled the program when one entered the `RUN` command. The dialect was very close to MSX BASIC. The major differences were the lack of the `PLAY`, `SOUND`, `VPOKE` and `PUT SPRITE` operators, the inability to open several files at the same time, and the inability to use more than one operator on one line. Only the UKNC version had a full-screen editor. Machine-dependent features, like graphics operators parameters and `PEEK`/`POKE` addresses were also different.'
- 'The software was developed at Vilnius University, located in Lithuania which was a republic of the Soviet Union at the time.'

###### 'In computer science, threaded code is a programming technique where the code has a form that essentially consists entirely of calls to subroutines. It is often used in compilers, which may generate code in that form or be implemented in that form themselves. The code may be processed by an interpreter or it may simply be a sequence of machine code call instructions. Threaded code has better density than code generated by alternative generation techniques and by alternative calling conventions. In cached architectures, it may execute slightly slower. However, a program that is small enough to fit in a computer processor's cache may run faster than a larger program that suffers many cache misses. Small programs may also be faster at thread switching, when other programs have filled the cache. Threaded code is best known for its use in many compilers of programming languages, such as Forth, many implementations of BASIC, some implementations of COBOL, early versions of B, and other languages for small minicomputers and for amateur radio satellites' https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threaded_code

- 'Earlier models of DVK series were based on K1801VM1 or K1801VM2 microprocessors with 16 bit address bus. In the later models, the KM1801VM3 microprocessor (with 22 bit extended address bus) was used.'

- today[^8] `\e\` OS is getting into the market putting back google’s Android while promoting `entirely different moral\ethical values` —no survellance over the user + free cloud services + streamlined user interface + OTA updates + system based on famous source + no‑third‑party app base&store
- but as one of `linux` kernel developers has said 'if there is no linux —there is no android' ...so if there is no android —there is no \e\
- ...so maybe there would be no `google` and no `linus torvalds` —but `impressively performant russian OS` called by cosmopolite wikipedians `Fodos Mobile` would take up the Future[^9]
