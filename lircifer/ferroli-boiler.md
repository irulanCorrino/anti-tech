- before you read this i must warn you that i do not like using fossil fuels in general not only in relation to the subject of this entry.
- my Home World does not have any fossil fuels at all and we inhabitants of Gethen are just fine with that.

### here is the Story:
- long before Soviet Union has collapsed inhabitants of rural areas of Ukraine have lost most of their resources needed for living a healthy
life or even simply for keep living. in end years of 80s living in Crimea i had no warm tap water and in beginning of 90s i had no electric
power and municipal gas and water supply... i still visited the school and was brainwashed there still.
- when Ukraine has gained the independence it was a significant improvement to my life.
- when Ukraine has broken up with Soviet Communist Party's ideology it was a significant improvement to my life.
- i still had no municipal gas supply and water and electric power were scarcely provided. but i felt myself being free from my Soviet past.
- i was brainwashed still. but i have found that russian language is not the only revelation in Universe.
- and i have noticed that it is not optimal --say not a perfect language.
- then i had begun considering myself bilingual. it was my ordinary life until i had come across old all-machine-code dump of 'Lode Runner'
written in assembly for an ancient 8-bit computer that has triggered something in my inborn memory making me trying to visualise actual source.
- i did never see actual game --only read its description in that DIY magazine. i tried as well to map the code to the description finding
the sprites and a dungeon in it.
- it had somewhat coincided with a publication of provocative pseudo-moral horror short story by a Communist Party's children outlet branded
together with their main newspaper 'The Truth'. there were series of such publications in various communist printed media for children
all targeting the same subject: addictive computer gaming. but these particular one was especially horrid --it depicted 'Virtual Tomb' from
which infant gamers never return. and not wondering... they all were boys and were playing War Game... being a girl i was not touched by
political message of the horrid short story --but being a weaver [a medium] i have gotten horrid nightmares themed and styled as such and
getting worse with every flu event or an intoxication.
- some years later when i have started learning english and programming seriously [in fourteen, in 1994] i have managed to suppress that
horrid brainplug and to take a course away from ordinary life as well.
- in teenage years little by little i have gotten all things that i missed in childhood. much longer time was needed to get rid of the brainwashing.
---
- at some point when i was about thirty the people that adopted me had bought their second boiler. it was decisively cheaper in usage and more
convenient than electrically powered heating tank we had before it.
- it has happened not so long [by karhider's means] after there was municipal gas supply introduced back in our village.
- at first i was fascinated by possibility to have warm water any moment.
- but after realising that the acquisition of that resource is not oh so clean as it is advertised i had had some doubt on morality of using it.
- later it has evolved in a strong disgust. infamous appliance had had its undefined behavior revealed by me.
- it has a complex behavioural pattern: firstly i receive cool water (from long pipe) then at last i have warm water... but then it tries
to boil my skin to blisters after what doing it stops giving hot water at all and for a couple of pipe's volumes i wait for warm water.
- and even worse: if people that adopted me use the boiler before me (or i open a tap connected at parallel pipeline) then all the pattern has
its temperature shifted up to twenty-thirty degrees!!! ...they try to cut on water bill while opening the taps at a quater of full flow.
- and that is me who tunes the settings see? a guy doing the service of stupid device never bothers with my burns and sets it to some plainly
ridiculous values! it is impossible to get lower temperature for full volume of water passing the douche with the value i can get using device's knob...
- the device just shuts gas valve then. i mean that not only at summer i have to dilute hot water but during every season.
- it is impossible to set flash value lower than i do and i guess that is not a firmware bug. it just does not ignite then.
- one may say 'why not dilute boiling water with cold water? do not bother with your programmer's ethics and engage cold line's valve'.
- but pipes are made of a plastic see? they are second generation though --first generation pipes had cracked open!!!
- imagine all amount of organic trash leaking into boil hot water...
- the manual of appliance hypocritically mentions 'optional flow temperature sensor'. 'no we will not buy it! we have more important needs than
satisfying your caprices'
