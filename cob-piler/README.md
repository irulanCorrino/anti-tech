## 'A web page that either has not been updated for a long time, or that is rarely visited.' [wiktionary]
- i understand that necessity of keeping information fresh is undeniable law of physics!!!
- but i have galaxy tab 2 and the heaviest load on her is put by [obsolete] web browser.
- i do not like both Opera and google's Chrome. but there are no other browsers for Android 4.2 and Chrome crashes every five minutes so i stick with Opera.
- i as well understand that good hardware manufacturer [namely samsung] may not be a superstar in making user applications or even in adopting a system to the hardware.
- `but i need real progress not temporary achievements`
- so i cannot accept 'dismissive' attitude of the informational industry to my not oh so old machines. i have four computers and they all are considered being low-power 
 mainstream consumer products both by representatives of industry and children in a local school here.
- and i do not believe that if becoming such representatives those cryptomaniac children would write software that may have any value for me poor old programmer.
