i had so many troubles with viewing gitlab's content.  
now i was successfull with registering an account at xfce's gitlab. i have autologged with my github account.

so happy about this.
but what if i want to use my older smartphone or the tablet to view someting there?  
they cannot run github already...

i hope my husband or a wife would lease a device to me if they return to reunite
