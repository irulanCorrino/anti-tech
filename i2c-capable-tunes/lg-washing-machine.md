# 'the question is not if washing machine compliant to ideology of ruling party but HOW MANY REPORTS does it send monthly!'
- i don't like if people ridicule music.
- i mean i don't like if people ridicule me.
- i don't like if someone ridicule beauty.
- i had seen trashy video tagged 'Dry Cleaning' that depicted woman showing face in some frame who pretended to be a vocalist but she did not sing but plainly talked.
- and YES LG has spent 50000$ for covering damage from Ida flooding but that is a cost of ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY of their washing machines.
- i have calculated that from an end price of 800$ divided by two for finding real cost of making washing machine.
- ### so what is washing machine made by LG worth of?
- `a.` it continues to work AFTER I PUSH POWER BUTTON;
- `b.` it takes too little of water for washing the stuff during main program;
- `c.` it takes not enough water for washing off the washer;
- `d.` it releases the valve once again AFTER PASSING FROM DRAINING TO TUMBLING STAGE issuing huge portion of dirty soapy water stored under the drum;
- `e.` it repeats ACTION#D then several times with lesser amounts of dirt before going to tumbling stage;
- `f.` it is impossible to program it for washing off the washer a multiple of times --so called 'Superwashing' program warms the water to 30Â¤C and makes two dryish turns;
- `g.` it audibly LOADS SOME DATA before starting washing program --`'completeness_bit' => 'conditional block' => 'sensor_state' => 'conditional block' => 'some decisions'`;
- `h.` IT REMEMBERS PREVIOUS PROGRAM!!! once i had noticed it has shortened 'Cotton Washing - Intensive' to 'Cotton Quickly' AFTER I HAD INTERRUPTED[^1][^2]
PREVIOUS 'CWI' program to set it for another 'CWI' turn.
- `conclusion.` it has `flash memory` and potentialy some reporting capability in a manner of `I2C-over-power-line` (idk).

- and it riducules music (`call for my shadow`) playing some trash and calculating a speed of double click.
[^1]: Update: seven months later after making this mock i have run into a trouble --it cannot control its valve --i mean, yes, indeed it is A STATE MACHINE, but ...if pushing 'Power' during 'Draining' a trouble occurs ...badly. the only solution is to force it doing some petty work and the valve is closed by its own.
CITATION: 'We can control all of user activity but we cannot control our valve' --LG Electronics
[^2]: Update[2]: no. it just throws the washer down the well quietly. i've found this while taking shower during the 'CWI' laundry programm running. is like `-pre-washing-` option but without next accepting the main portion of the washer
