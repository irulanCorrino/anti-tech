#### "Helicopter Dream (I'm Awake)" [no external XFS journal held on laptop's cardreader]

- once long before i had heard Beach House for first time i was walking by a street and some two guys who i assume had recognized me were talking strangely.
- i am with a sad fame in this village you see... i assume most of people here once knew something on music i listen to or on circumstances of my past or were
in some details of my personal relationships or details of my mysticism.
- i listened alternative rock music fed to me by then-foreign russian satellite channel.
- i was not deeply in social life then so all i had was from satellite channels as i also had no internet or maybe even a computer.
- i never heard about Pitchfork by that moment. certainly tv channels were up to date but they were not oh so deeply into the stream as the mob with network was.
- that guy had mumbled [using 'traditional' russian swear word] '[she] ~~fled~~ for whatever knows...' i could not understand about whom he said that.

---
- another time i walked by a street and there were people sitting on a bench. passing by them i had heard a girl shouting 'Vikka!'
- and i could not understand that. i never heard about 'modern witch society' as well.

---
- but soonly [by karhider's means] after i have begun listening Beach House i had realised that those men mentioned the singer of group.
- and i have read about Wicca at wikipedia as well.

---
- now i am sure in that of those people have forgotten every `little shadow` of a musician they once were avantguarding-in and cheek-in-tongueing.
- they as well listened infamous offensive hoaxcast and believed believed ...forgetting Beach House next morning you know.

###### ~~this my repository is dedicated to `design misfits`~~
you may imagine all the consequences of one such particular misfit mentioned in repository's description:
- an `external XFS journal` placed at a built-in cardreader (i have not found anything as that but an imaginative reading of manual is quiet sufficient source)
